Team 09 Project Code for Databases.

Pulling from WebAPI: For the way I am implementing pulling from the WebAPIs to populate the database, the database as well as tables with the correct names must already be set up i.e. for playerdata you will need a table for the Players with their first_name, last_name, etc. Or it will not populate correctly. We can attempt to figure out another solution if we want.
